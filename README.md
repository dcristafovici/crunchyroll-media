## Author's Comments to Reviewers

Unfortunately, being limited in time, I did not complete all the scenarios, and there are also a bunch of improvements needed. Anyway, I tried my best to create a clean project with a scalable architecture using the Feature Slide design. I aimed to design functions as closely as possible to a real project, making them scalable and usable in different places.

### Areas for Improvement with More Time

1. **Form Validation**

   - Enhance the validation process for forms.

2. **Form Handling, Including Reset**

   - Improve the handling of forms, including the reset functionality.

3. **Splitting Async and Non-Async Functions from Store**

   - Separate asynchronous and non-asynchronous functions within the store.

4. **Adding Unit Tests**

   - Implement unit tests to ensure robust code.

5. **Adding Spinner for Loading**

   - Include a spinner component to indicate loading states.

6. **Adding Error Handling Mechanism**

   - Implement a mechanism for handling errors gracefully.

7. **Ensuring Correct Types in Few Places**
   - Review and correct data types in specific areas.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
